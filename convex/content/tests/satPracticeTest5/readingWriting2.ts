        'Establishing protected areas (PAs), such as Abrolhos Marine Park in Brazil, is a common conservation strategy, but because PAs restrict some kinds of economic activity, it’s widely thought that they hinder economic development. This perception is driven in part by the fact that economic assessments often don’t capture the indirect effects of tourism linked to PAs.

Although RSRs are intended to benefit consumers, Naoki Aizawa and Ami Ko note that RSRs could curtail insurers’ profits to such a degree that insurers abandon the market, thereby reducing the competitive pressure that typically restrains premium prices for newly issued policies. To determine whether this occurred in Montana, students first collect data on the number of insurers in the state for a few years leading up to and following 2009 and the premium prices for new policies offered by those insurers.',

Sidrys’s 1976 study, or to glean aspects of cultural identity, as in Dennis Ogburn and colleagues’ 2009 study.
